# O
- STM & Code Review (`multiplicationTable`)
- Unit Test & fix bugs cost (Google example)
- TDD introduction & Mars Rover Practice

# R
Amazed
- *Learning & Thinking* when conducting code review, be *surprised* by different ideas and implementation about `multiplicationTable` from others.
- *TDD is so powerful* that we can use it to *improve code quality*, *convenience of code refactoring* and *reduce bug fix costs.*

# I
- Seeing others' excellent implementation in code review makes me want to do better.
- STM & ORID are really beneficial to help us summary and prospect
- The most meaning aspect should return to today's topic TDD, it help us ensure that the software works as intended, promotes better code design, and increases overall code quality.

# D
- As what I mention on STM, I'll *consider more details* when doing tasking.
- After a day of TDD learning and practice, I'll take actions to *use TDD method* into my coding practice.
- *Time planning* is also vital for developer, I'll *set priorities* not only in coding but in the whole software life cycle in the days followed.
